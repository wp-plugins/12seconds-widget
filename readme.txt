* The *username* attribute is required and is the login/user name to the 12seconds site. 
* The *size* attribute is optional and can be "fat" or "skinny" (default).

Use the `[12svideo]` shortcode to display a single video:

     `[12svideo id="123456"]`
	 
* The *id* attribute is required. 
* The *id* is the last set of digits of the URL when viewing a video on the 12seconds.tv site. The URLs takes the form `http://12seconds.tv/channel/username/123456` . The *id* in this case would be "123456".
